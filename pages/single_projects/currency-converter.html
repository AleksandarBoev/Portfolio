projectDescriptionParagraphs:
    - Team project about a currency converter web application, which serves as a tool for calculating amounts of money from one currency to another as well as giving a history of currency values and graphs which follows changes in currency values over time.
    - Front-end is developed with React, hosted on "firebase", has logic for calculating amounts of money from one currency to another as well as building graphs. The application sends requests to the back-end server and gets responses in JSON format, which then it saves on the users device temporarily.
    - Back-end is developed with Java and Spring, is hosted on "Heroku" and serves as a REST API for the front-end. The primary function is to perform web scraping of data (collect information from other websites using their HTML), save it to a database and provide the information to the front-end when needed. Additional functionalities include performing the web scraping at specific hours of the day and having logic for scraping from a second website in case the first one goes down.
    - My involvement in the project includes working on the back-end, and more specifically - writing validations for the collected scraped data, writing tests for those validations and implementing the database. Also participated in the overall discussions about the project itself and its functionalities.
    - Teammates for the project were <a href="https://github.com/axereliat"><strong>Mario Markov</strong></a> and <a href="https://github.com/nike799"><strong>Nikolay Grozdanov</strong></a>.
